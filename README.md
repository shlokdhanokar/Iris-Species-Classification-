# Iris-Species-Classification-
Classify iris flowers into one of the three species based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.


Solution Approach:


1.Load the Iris dataset using load_iris from sklearn.datasets.

2.Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

3.Preprocess using StandardScaler

4.Train a classifier, using LogisticRegression, on the training set.

5.Evaluate the classifier on the testing set using Industry standard techniques.

6.Visualise the results, using standard visualisation tools and Find the best Metric for the problem
